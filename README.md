# RupeePulse Rewards Hacker Terminal Prank

## Description
The **RupeePulse Rewards Hacker Terminal Prank** is a **purely fictional, entertainment-only** web application designed to simulate a fake hacking scenario for fun. It mimics an Indian-themed fintech website ("RupeePulse Rewards") offering a ₹5000 reward in partnership with Paytm and PhonePe. Clicking "Verify Eligibility" triggers a mock "hacking" terminal with commands, error messages, and Windows-style pop-up modals, culminating in a "SYSTEM BREACH COMPLETE" message. Post-hack, users can interact with a fake command prompt, see a ransomware modal, and experience a glitch effect for added realism.
